For this project, I hade to make a Database using MySQL.

The task was to create a Jobs Database (like Indeed), which kept tables for Candidate Names, the Jobs listed, and the Companies that were advertising.

This was my first experience in Databases and Data Engineering, as I developed new skills like Normalisation and writing a Data Dictionary. 

I very much enjoyed this project and using SQL/MySQL, which I found easy to pick up and use.
